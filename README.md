This is the attempt to start a new todo tool, although there are actually already some with different approaches. I have tried many different solutions over a long period of time, both for myself and for different collectives and working groups that try to organize themselves in different ways. Unfortunately I was never really satisfied with solutions in Kanban or Scrum Style.

Because I never found a satisfying solution for a problem: The interdependence of tasks. [Example] Although there are a few tools that have rudimentarily hidden such a function, I believe that this kind of structuring can be elementary in many situations in order to have an overview of the upcoming possibilities for action.

The idea is to put all plans into dependencies and see a result at the end and my concrete tasks and possibilities at the current point in time. But to include later upcoming tasks at any time and not to lose sight of them.

Actually I would like to try this idea and start coding, but unfortunately I don't have the time and I'm not good enough in implementing dynamic interfaces. But I think it's very important to have a nice clear structure, with clear simple FOrmes, good colors, simple buttons and an understandable UI. In order to push, dock, re-create, solve and highlight tasks in a nice and maybe a little playful way. I think it would be good to go there from the surface into the backend, and not to start the backend and then tinker with the frontend.

For this I am looking for contributors who have a plan of website UI (i.e. JS etc.), graphics, also backend, databases etc. I will present my ideas for the project here and see if people are interested in helping to realize the idea.

I have some conditions for the project:

- Security and privacy are my first priority
- A simple and clear surface
- No loading of external content by default (jquery, gravatar etc.)
- open source
- python/django, so a web portal
- mysql and postgres capable
- multilingual
- very good documentation, good variable naming, good comments on every commit, instructions for self-hosting, later a proper documentation in sphinx for example and so on
